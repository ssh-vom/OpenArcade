# Motherboard V1 Communication Protocol Spec 

## Purpose:

This document aims to list out the possible modes of messaging over BLE and HID for the 
Motherboard communicating from child-board to motherboard and vice-versa. 

## High-Level Flow:


1. `BOOT`/`HELLO`: Child-board sends HELLO message (`capabilities, num_buttons, unique id, fw_version`)
board may enter a `CONFIG\_WAIT`
2. Motherboard collects HELLO messages, assigns mappings based on profiles and requests.
3. `CONFIG`: Motherboard sends packet to all boards in `CONFIG_WAIT` with config information,
debounce, reporting, etc.
4. `CONFIG_ACK`: Child-board confirms receipt of messaging, upon success enters the `INPUT`
mode.
5. `INPUT`: Child-board sends it's button state each tick while the Motherboard monitors and aggregates
6. `AGGREGATE`: Motherboard converts the input streams collected into a bitfield for an HID report.
7. `SEND`: Motherboard sends the HID report. (Follows a similar nature to UDP, where we ignore missed packets
and move onto the next packet)

## Packet-Framing

Messages will occur in the following order and types:

[ Characteristic (1B) | Type (1B) | Length (1B) | Payload (N bytes) | CRC16 (2B) ]

`Type` = packet type enum

`Length` = payload length in bytes

`CRC16` = Checksum, may not be required if the transport is secure.

## Packet Types (Type byte)

| Value | Name        | Direction | Purpose                                |
|------:|-------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| 0x01  | HELLO       | Sub→Main  | Announces capabilities on boot          |
| 0x02  | CONFIG      | Main→Sub  | Assign offset, debounce, rate, modes    |
| 0x03  | CONFIG_ACK  | Sub→Main  | Accept/reject config                    |
| 0x04  | INPUT       | Sub→Main  | Regular bitfield + seq packet           |
| 0x05  | HEARTBEAT   | Sub→Main  | Keepalive if no INPUT sent recently     |
| 0x06  | INFO        | Sub↔Main  | Diagnostics, version, NVM request       |


## Payloads

### `HELLO` (child &rarr; mother)
```
uint8_t version; // protocol minor version
uint8_t reserved; // align
uint8_t num_buttons; // local count (1..64)
uint8_t capability_flags; // bitfield: ANALOG(1), ENCODER(2), etc
uint32_t unique_id; // optional, 0 if not present
uint16_t fw_ver; // firmware version
```

### `CONFIG` (mother &rarr; child)
```
```

### `CONFIG_ACK` (mother &rarr; child)
```
```

### `INPUT` (child &rarr; mother)

```
```



# GPIO Mapping Layout For Each Child Board

Button 1: GPIO5
Button 2: GPIO6
Button 3: GPIO7
Button 4: GPIO8
Button 5: GPIO9
Button 6: GPIO10
Button 7: GPIO11
Button 8: GPIO12
Reverse enough space for joysticks: GPIO[13,14,15,16]


Model: {KeyList: GPIO}

(We hard number each corresponding model's buttons to match)



Board:

GPIO Format needs to be determined
We need to create the multicore working model

*Raspberry Pi (Motherboard)*
    - Most likely swapping out of python for this 
        - Might be C, C++, Rust (Need to use the system hci layer messaging like gatttool does)
            - Hopefully library to do this in the above mentioned languages 
            - Need to look at a different BlueZ/BLE specific library for reading
                - Look at simpleBLE/bindings/find out any performance bottlenecks in the library
                - Look at bumble library (still in python) https://github.com/google/bumble
    - Polling (BLE read from child devices)
        - Arbitration / forming big packet for HID
    - Pairing 
        - 
    - HID
    - Possibly config
    - Need to make this properly cleaned, i.e. ensure that the code does the following:
    - Automatically startup and have the scanning core, polling core, hid core, etc running
    - Send messages with a message queue, pipes, or sockets, etc
*ESP32 Child Board*
    - Need to ensure that all the GPIO pins are working and running based on interrupts for button presses
    - Properly parse the joystick messaging 
    - Ensure it follows documented packet type enums (both sides aka raspberry pi and esp32)
    - Ensure that we store all necessary mappings of control for the HID core/aggregation/configuration
        ( on main board receiving from the child board )

Next Steps: 

*Child Board ESP32*:
1. We need to test joystick -> get joystick working on GPIO
2. Packet types: [ Characteristic (1B) | Type (1B) | Length (1B) | Payload (N bytes) | CRC16 (2B) ]
    - Create packet payloads for each type in packet enum table
3. Clean up the code for the esp32 to remove some of the starter
    - Slowly replacing functionality from the BLE example
    - This is required because we also need to implement kind of state machine of 
        - BOOT
        - Advertise
        - Send (Paired)
        - Need to add structured information about Paired status
        Need to also figure out reporting on ADC pins for battery life
4. Convert current code to send entire bitfield of all gpio button states.

5. Adding button for power on/off for the physical board
    - I think mitchel made a physical switch
6. Need to add a pairing button for beginning advertise (Maybe will just start and stop advertisement)

*Motherboard Raspberry Pi*:
1. Convert code to new framework/language 
    - Probably needs bare-bones quick notification reading test again
    - Look at simpleBLE/bindings/find out any performance bottlenecks in the library
    - Look at bumble library (still in python) https://github.com/google/bumble
    - Other possible libraries could be looked at 
    - If none of the libraries have functionality we need might have to write directly to blueZ linux staclk
2. Implement 4 core model
    - Pairing on 1 core (Lower duty cycle, as only needs to look for new devices sometimes) (always scanning)
        - Needs to send message to either socket, pipe, or message queue of device id that is connected
    - Polling BLE on 1 core (This is always reading once there is a device in paired status)
        - Reads the devices that are currently paired and polls their notifications
        - Aggregates the messages on each tick to pass to the HID writer
    - HID on 1 core 
    - Possibly config on 1 core 



Configurator application:
    - Determining the HID format 
    - Being able to edit how the configuration aggregates/updates the HID 
    - Map from CAD model directly to the UI and be able to edit the underlying button meaning for each board
        - Board ID -> Mapping of bit field i.e. bit 0 is button 1, bit 2 is button 2, etc reserving
        space for each joystick as well 
        - This needs to translate to a proper meaning
            - This needs to map to the HID reporting programmatically


*PCB*:
- Probably need to double check that esp32 is already firmware imaged
- Should happen in parallel does not block the design of the other components/working on the board
